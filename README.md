-----------------

Question2Answer is an open source project with no "commercial arm". There is also other developers that release third-party free and paid plugins. Scott Vivian and Gideon (Q2A's creator) don't receive any money from them or anyone else. Some other service providers are listed here.

So yes, you are absolutely free to make an open source plugin that does the same thing as a commercial one (as long as you're not copying their code directly, of course).
